Created by Jackson Pickard

The Pokedex app displays 120 (currently) pokemon and details about them. Data is loaded through an external api (https://pokeapi.co/). 

The app utilizes html, javascript, and css, as well as jquery and bootstrap.

The Pokedex app was developed to learn javascript basics.
